Data Parallel Reduction

1.  How many times does your thread block synchronize to reduce its portion
    of an array to a single value?

	considering this question for reducing a single block: 
	one synchronization for loading the global memory to shared memory.
	also, after each level, we synchronize the threads:
	i.e., log(BLOCK_SIZE) <- since the first add is done part of the load, this reduces
	one synchronization  {from log(BLOCK_SIZE*2) to log(BLOCK_SIZE) }

2.  What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations
    that a thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly
    contribute to the final reduction value, i.e., iterations of the reduction
    computation.

	minimum no of operations a thread could perform : 1 (if the threads are handling far end of shared memory,
	they just do the load and first add operation)
	average, maximum no of operations : O(log N) ; N -> BLOCK_SIZE
